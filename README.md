# FRC-2019
Software engineering goals:
- [ ] Step 1: Look into all options of vision sensing
- [ ] Step 2: Decide what code would be best for our intrests
- [ ] Step 3: Integrate with our robot code
- [ ] Step 4: Recognize the target and location
- [ ] Step 5: Build tracking algorithim
- [ ] Step 6: Have it follow the markers / actually run it

How to install CScore:
- Step 1: Make sure you have Robotpy-installer on the device
- Step 2: Connect to the internet
- Step 3: Open console and run "robotpy-installer download-opkg python37-robotpy-cscore"
- Step 4: Connect to a roboRio
- Step 5: Open the console and run "robotpy-installer install-opkg python37-robotpy-cscore"

If These steps don't work or if you don't have Robotpy-installer
go to https://robotpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/install/cscore.html and follow the steps posted there
This is the source of these steps

Make sure to always download in http://frcvision.local/ 
with the raspberry pi powered and connected to the device using ethernet or Radio
1. go to the application tab
2. change the file type to a custom python code
3. switch over to the writable mode
4. add the chicken vision file and save it
